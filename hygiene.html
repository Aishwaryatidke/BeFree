   <br><h1><strong><font size="+5">The Basics of Hygiene during menstrual periods </font> </strong></h1><br> 
    <p><font size = 5px> &nbsp; &nbsp; When a girl has a period for the first time, it is a distinct step into womanhood. But with the onset of puberty comes a number of concerns, like ‘How to use a sanitary napkin effectively?’, ‘How to stay clean during those days?’ and, ‘How to deal with your changing body?</br>Learning the basics of menstrual hygiene helps to ensure that you and the women in your life are fully informed about the right way to stay healthy and avoid infection during menstruation.<br>It is essential that each woman understand the best practices for period hygiene along with the actions and situations that put them at risk in order to maintain a healthy menstrual routine.<br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Here are some tips to maintain hygiene during your periods, some of which you may not know about:</strong></font></p><br>
    
	<ul><font size="+2"><li><strong>1. Methods of Sanitation:</strong></li><p>First and foremost is the type of sanitation you choose during your periods. Today there are different ways for women to adopt to stay clean and hygienic. It includes the use of sanitary napkins, tampons or menstrual cups. Thankfully, it’s not like the days where women had to use cloth! Yes, it is still followed in rural parts of India. In urban India most unmarried girls prefer using a sanitary napkin or menstrual cup. Menstrual cups are feminine hygiene products, used as an alternative to sanitary pads or tampons. There are a variety of sanitary napkins brand available in the market to use, here is a tip, choose one brand you are most comfortable with because inferior quality can make one feel uncomfortable and lowers her confidence during periods.<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>
	It is probably the most important aspect of a girl’s period, since it helps you stay comfortable, prevents staining and keeps you clean and dry throughout the day. </p><br><br>
		<li><strong>2. Change your pads regularly:</strong></li><p>Not only maintaining sanitation is important but also changing your pads at regular intervals of time is of equal importance because menstrual blood gets contaminated with the body’s innate organism. The pads will contain microorganisms from the vagina. If napkin or pads are not changed periodically, these organisms with multiply and cause infection. This is applicable even if the bleeding is not heavy, so you have to make sure to alter your schedule and change your napkins every 6 hours or depending on the flow the timing can be shortened.<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>Sanitary napkins are made of cotton wool and gel. When you bleed into one, most of the blood gets soaked in, but at a certain point the pad gets saturated and may leak.  Another consideration is that menstrual blood – once it has left the body – gets contaminated with the body’s innate organisms. This rule applies for even those days when you don’t have much bleeding, since your pad is still damp and will have organisms from your vagina, sweat from your genitals, etc. When these organisms remain in a warm and moist place for a long time they tend to multiply and can lead to conditions like urinary tract infection, vaginal infections and skin rashes. Therefore changing is essential.<br>

 

In the case of tampons it is very important because, if left inserted into the vagina for long periods of time it can cause a condition called TSS or toxic shock syndrome – a condition where bacteria infiltrate the body leading to severe infection that can send to the body into shock – that requires emergent treatment and can lead to serious complications and even death.  

 </p><br>
    <li>
		<strong>3. Using a menstrual cup:</strong>
    </li><p>A menstrual cup is a small, flexible, bell-shaped cup made up of medical grade silicone or latex rubber. Instead of absorbing the menstrual flow like a tampon or pad, a menstrual cup catches and collects it. It is then removed and emptied. Sanitary pads and tampons need discarding, but menstrual cups are reusable for many cycles. Therefore, one menstrual cup can substitute many disposable products (pads or tampons).You can wear the menstrual cup for 4-12 hours based on your flow.You can also clean and disinfect the menstrual cup based on manufacturers instructions<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>The menstrual cup is comfortable.It does not dry you out or disrupt your vaginal ph levels.You can wear it up to 12h.Menstrual cups are healthy: they have never been associated with TSS

(Toxic Shock Syndrome).Menstrual cups are healthy and you know then they are clean. Although most women think pads and tampons have been sterilized, they have not.You can do any kind of sports: Yoga, pilates, horse riding, cycling, running and even swimming. You can even sleep naked safely while wearing one all night!You can wear a menstrual cup ahead of time when you are expecting your period. If you know your periods are due today and you will be at work, just put your cup in the morning and you don’t have to worry about it. You can’t do that with tampons.The menstrual cup is invisible while in useMenstrual cups do not leak chemicals into the bodyThe material has natural antibacterial properties, and washes clean.  So menstrual cups are healthy and perfectly safe to re-use as recommended.</p><br>
    <li>
		<strong>4. When on the go:</strong> 
    </li><p>
    	Sometimes it’s difficult to change and clean when you are on a long and continuous journey, what best can be done is use a fresh napkin before you start and always carry a spare one in the case of emergency. It is always advisable to change your napkins whenever you get a chance.A menstrual cup lasts 2 to 3 times longer than a pad or tampon (up to 12 hours), which is a big advantage for overnight use and when there is a lack of bathroom facilities.<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>Changing your pads/ tampons regularly is essential, so you will need extra. More importantly storing them properly so that they don’t get contaminated is as important as changing. Pads or tampons that remain in your bag without a clean pouch to protect it can also lead to infections like UTI (urinary tract infection) or vaginal infections. The soft towel can be used to wipe your hands or face if you wash them. Paper towels are the important to wipe off the excess water after you wash your private parts. It is best you don’t use toilet paper for this as it tends to shred and tear when it touches water. Your hand sanitizer is a very important factor here. You will need it to clean your hands and you can use it to clean the flush knob and tap faucet as well. The snack is a backup in case you feel weak or run down during the day and the bottle of water is to help you stay hydrated throughout the day.

It is important to understand that periods are a sign of fertility and good health. Shunning it and the woman who is having it will only lead to depression and a sense of self loathing in the girl.
    </p>
    <br>
		<li><strong>5. Keep a spare change of clothes:</strong></li><p>Always carry a change of clothes for any mishappening. You should be having the option to change your clothes if they have been soiled. Always wear cotton undergarments.</p><br>
		<li><strong>6. Washing and cleaning yourself:</strong></li><p>Along with changing the pads and re-using a menstrual cup, one should also make sure to wash and clean the discharged blood before using a new pad or menstrual cup, so that there is no cause of infection. If there is the unavailability of water to wash make sure to use a clean toilet paper or wet tissue to wipe.  Also, make sure to use a proper procedure to wash the vaginal surroundings by making use of warm water. Always wash from vagina to the anal opening. Making use of soap is not a very good idea as it may kill the good bacteria that may further lead to infections.<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>When you menstruate, the blood tends to enter tiny spaces like the skin between your labia or crust around the opening of the vagina and you should always wash this excess blood away. This practice also tends to beat bad odour from the vaginal region.

  </p><br>
		<li><strong>7. Discard your used napkins and tampons properly: </strong></li><p>
    	Another essential point is to discard your used napkins and tampons properly because they can spread infection with very foul smell. The used napkins and tampons need to be wrapped in a proper disposal cover so that the smell and infection are contained. Moreover, it’s advised not to flush down the napkins in the toilet bowl as it causes blockage to the drainage system. Washing your hands before and after disposal is equally important.While travelling, buying or disposing of pads and tampons may be a worry. Menstrual cups are perfect for such situations as they can be reused, need less space, and there would be no problem of discarding them.<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>It is essential to discard your used napkins or tampons properly because they are capable of spreading infections, will smell very foul and is just disgusting for the person using the washroom after you. Wrapping it well before discarding it ensures that the smell and infection is contained. It is advised not to flush the pad or tampon down the toilet since they are capable of forming a block and can cause the toilet to back up. More importantly it is imperative that you wash your hands well after you discard your used napkin since you are likely to touch the used portion of the pad or tampon while discarding it. Apart from that public or commonly used toilets are dirty, even if they look clean. This is because while one can clean the toilet bowl and seat, he/she will not be able to clean the door handle, the lock knob, the tap faucet, flush knob etc. All these objects are touched by people who have visited the washroom and are capable of transferring harmful organisms that could not only lead to infections down there, but also other diseases like diarrhoea, typhoid etc.
    </p><br>
		<li><strong>8. Antiseptic for pad rashes:</strong></li><p>
    	Most of us get a napkin rash during our periods. Apply antiseptic ointment to the area. Keep it moisture free and change into dry napkins as often as possible.Unlike pads and tampons, a menstrual cup does not contain chemicals, perfumes or other substances that may potentially be harmful to health.Menstrual cups made of medical grade silicone is suitable for those known to have sensitive skin, dermatitis, latex allergies and other skin allergies.<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>Pad rashes can be extremely uncomfortable and painful. In some cases they may get infected and lead to a more severe condition. Moreover constant pad rashes tend to stain the area causing it to darken.

    </p><br>
    <li>
		<strong>9. Other basic hygiene which you can follow:</strong> 
    </li><br><p>
    	
    1. Take a shower<br>
    2. Always carry an extra napkin and towel with you<br>
    3. Keep a hand sanitizer.<br>
    4. Store your napkins, menstrual cups and tampons the right way to prevent infections like Urinary tract infection<br>
    5. Always carry some snacks and a water bottle in case you feel weak will always keep you prepared and make you feel confident at the time of your period.<br><br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>Bathing not only cleanses your body but also gives you a chance to clean your private parts well. It also helps relieve menstrual cramps, backaches, helps improve your mood and makes you feel less bloated. To get some relief from backaches and menstrual cramps, just stand under a shower of warm water that is targeted towards your back or abdomen. You will feel much better at the end of it.

 

    </p><br>
    <li>
		<strong>10. New products on offer</strong>
    </li><p>
    	New products coming now and then in the market to make women more comfortable and relaxed in their period like period panties, panty liners are some of them. Keep a tab on these and do not hesitate to try them out. They spell comfort for a woman of today.<br><br>
	
    </p><br>
    <li>
		<strong>11. Talk and share: </strong>
    </li><p>
    	 If you are facing issues relating to periods or hygiene, share with your gang. See how others are coping up with those red days of their life.<br><br>
	<strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>it's a neeed to talk about this cause there is nothing to afraid and shy of.
